## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting the prices of vehicles using machine learning. By analyzing historical data on vehicle prices and their corresponding features, we aim to build a predictive model that can assist in setting competitive prices for vehicles in the market.

## Features

Key features and functionalities of this project include:

- Predictive modeling of vehicle prices.
- Feature importance analysis to understand which factors influence vehicle prices the most.
- Regression model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Usage 

To use the project, follow these steps:
1. Download the Data within the file
2. Change the path of the dataset within the .ipynb file according to your file directory
3. Run the program

## Data

The data used in this project includes information about vehicles, such as mileage, year, engine specifications, and their corresponding prices. The dataset is structured in a CSV file.

## Model

The primary model used in this project is a regression model. 

## Evaluation 

The regression model's performance is assessed using the coefficient of determination (R-squared). The model achieved an R-squared score of 0.74, indicating a strong fit. This means that approximately 74% of the variance in vehicle prices is explained by the features (mileage, year, engine specifications) included in the model.

## Results 

The interpretation of the R-squared score is as follows:

- R-squared > 0.7: A strong fit, indicating that a significant portion of the variance in prices is explained by the features.

This strong fit suggests that the model is effective at capturing the underlying relationships between the features and the actual vehicle prices. However, it's important to keep in mind that while R-squared provides valuable insights, it should be considered alongside other metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the model's predictive capabilities.

Overall, an R-squared score of 0.74 is indicative of a well-performing regression model for predicting vehicle prices.
